# Theme API

A `.serein-extension` theme package contains a version 1 manifest with
`"kind": "theme"`, empty capabilities/actions, and a `theme` object. There is no
Wasm module. Import the package from Settings > Themes to try it locally.
The existing packages in [`extensions`](../extensions) are complete examples.

The `light` and `dark` objects each accept `colors` and an optional `backdrop`.
Color values are `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`. Supported color names are:

| Area | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Surfaces | `base`, `sidebar`, `chat`, `raised`, `hover`, `selected`, `border` |
| Text | `text_strong`, `text`, `muted`, `link` |
| Actions and states | `accent`, `accent_text`, `positive`, `warning`, `danger` |
| Mentions | `mention_bg`, `mention_text` |

`backdrop` is a two-color array for the existing top-to-bottom background
gradient. Omitted colors fall back to the selected built-in appearance; omitting
`backdrop` uses flat surfaces. The user's custom accent takes precedence.
Small controls and popouts composite translucent surfaces into opaque colors.

The optional `style` object customizes shared native controls in both appearances.
Every field is optional; omitted fields use the defaults below. Distances and
font sizes are whole logical pixels, before the user's display scale.

| Field | Default | Allowed range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `body_size` | 15 | 10–28 |
| `heading_size` | 20 | 12–40 |
| `button_size` | 14 | 10–28 |
| `small_size` | 12 | 10–28 |
| `monospace_size` | 14 | 10–28 |
| `item_spacing` | [8, 8] | Each axis 0–24 |
| `button_padding` | [12, 6] | Each axis 0–24 |
| `control_height` | 32 | 24–56 |
| `widget_radius` | 4 | 0–24 |
| `window_radius` | 8 | 0–24 |
| `menu_radius` | 8 | 0–24 |

For example, this `theme` value provides a flatter, roomier appearance:

```json
{
  "light": {"colors": {"accent": "#087F8C", "accent_text": "#FFFFFF"}},
  "dark": {"colors": {"chat": "#15252A", "accent": "#55CBD7", "accent_text": "#15252A"}},
  "style": {
    "body_size": 16,
    "button_padding": [16, 8],
    "control_height": 36,
    "widget_radius": 2,
    "window_radius": 4,
    "menu_radius": 4
  }
}
```

Unknown fields and out-of-range metrics are rejected before installation.
Existing color-only packages continue to work. Disabling or resetting a theme
restores built-in control metrics as well as colors; `Ctrl+Shift+F12` is the
emergency reset shortcut.

These metrics affect controls that inherit the shared native style. Custom
painted elements, explicit text sizes, fixed-height rows and per-widget padding
or radius overrides retain their own geometry. Shop thumbnails preview palette
colors, not all control metrics. Themes cannot rearrange application panels,
inject CSS/scripts, load fonts or images, fetch URLs, or change message data.

Run the offline validation/application example with:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p ui --example theme_api
```
