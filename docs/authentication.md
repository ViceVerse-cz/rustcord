# Authentication and owner-controlled live validation

Linux uses GTK4/WebKit6 with a fresh ephemeral NetworkSession and persistent credential
storage disabled. Normal TLS validation remains enabled. Scripts run at document start only
in the top Discord frame. Native navigation and candidate origin checks restrict the login
to https://discord.com. Popups, downloads, file choosers, permission requests, HTTP-auth,
notifications and printing are denied; embedded challenge availability remains unverified.

WebKit6 script-message callbacks lack trusted sender-frame metadata. The callback accepts
only a boolean wake signal. A protected main-frame closure retains one ASCII candidate of at
most 2113 bytes (65-byte capability plus 2048-byte token). A native main-frame query checks
origin and result bounds before creating a Rust string; Rust checks URI, capability, lifetime
and SessionSecret validation again. Queries are at least 100 ms apart, with one cancellable
evaluation and one secret slot. A child frame can only request a query of the main frame.

Close/drop invalidates pending results, clears the secret/scripts/handler, cancels evaluation,
stops loading, terminates the ephemeral web process and destroys the GTK window. GLib pumping
checks a 2-ms deadline between at most 16 callbacks; one native callback may exceed that time.
These are implemented limits, not measured teardown/storage or live login compatibility.

Serein uses Discord’s official login page in a temporary platform webview, not OAuth. The credential handoff is unofficial and live-unverified; see the compatibility matrix. Complete authentication yourself, in the application. Never send passwords, tokens, MFA codes, QR screenshots, or private message contents to the coding agent, issues, logs, or CI.

1. Build `cargo run --locked` on a supported platform. Use a private conversation controlled by the account owner. The owner enables the private-test acknowledgment and presses **Sign in with Discord**.
2. Complete one of the real login methods available in Discord’s page. Do not bypass a challenge or spoof a fingerprint if Discord rejects the engine. Cancel if the page or handoff is unsupported. The webview expires after ten minutes and closes when it supplies a candidate token.
3. Native REST verifies `/users/@me`, rejects a bot account, retrieves the gateway location, and waits for normal-user READY. A socket opening is not authentication success. The token is saved in the OS credential store only after readiness; if saving fails, the UI reports session-only login.
4. Choose the existing private channel/DM. Load one 50-message page. Deliberately compose and send one short test message. Verify it appears in an official Discord client. Reply from that official client and verify the reply appears natively through Gateway. Do not count an offline fixture, matching text, or a bot reply as success.
5. In the same conversation, verify an edit, deletion, HTTP/Gateway confirmation ordering, permission rejection if available, disconnect/resume and non-resumable reload. Keep traffic small; run stress tests only against synthetic transports.
6. Quit after local saves finish. Relaunch and verify credential-store restoration and saved draft recovery without opening the webview. Inspect recovered drafts before sending: an interrupted send can have succeeded remotely.
7. Log out and verify saved-login deletion and local account cache/draft cleanup. The UI must show credential-store or SQLite deletion failures. Local logout does not claim remote session revocation.

Record only date, OS/build, methods tested, pass/fail and redacted failure category in docs/progress.md. Never record credentials, account/channel IDs, signed URLs, message contents or QR data. **No real owner-controlled session was supplied or exercised during implementation; the live milestone remains blocked.**

A separate `--features developer-session` build exposes an explicitly labeled, RAM-only owner-provided token field for adapter diagnosis. It is not the normal login, is disabled in release packaging, and never permits extraction from other software.

Saved-login startup reports credential lookup separately from Discord connection. A found credential advances the status immediately; absent/invalid/unavailable outcomes remain visible. The UI stops awaiting lookup after 10 seconds and permits manual hosted login. Manual login, preview, logout and timeout discard late lookup results. The synchronous OS call remains on the existing single worker; no background retry workers or plaintext fallback are created.
