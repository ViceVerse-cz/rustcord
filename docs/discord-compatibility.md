# Discord compatibility — checked 2026-09-10

Webhook author profiles (September 12, 2026): the documented message
[`webhook_id`](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message#message-object)
marks the author as a webhook. Its popout shows the message's name/avatar and a
Webhook label, with no user-profile request or retry. Ordinary bot/user profiles
retain their existing behavior. Synthetic parser, cache, and UI checks cover this
path; live webhook interoperability and native visual verification are unverified.

## Group conversation actions — September 11, 2026

Group DM rows and the conversation header expose Edit Group, Mute/Unmute
Conversation, and Leave Group. Edit changes the name and optionally the group
icon; selecting an image prepares a local preview, and only Save sends it.
Leave requires confirmation and is blocked by pending messages or an active
call. Failed writes keep the editor draft; confirmed leave preserves text drafts.

Group edit uses documented `PATCH /channels/{id}` group-DM name/icon fields;
leave uses `DELETE /channels/{id}`. See Discord's [channel resource](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/channel#modify-channel)
and [group chat help](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/223657667-Group-Chat-and-Calls).
Mute reuses the existing unofficial account notification-settings route and
lasts until explicitly unmuted. Icon hashes hydrate from channel snapshots and
absent/null/value channel updates; static artwork uses the existing bounded CDN
worker with `channel-icons/{channel}/{hash}.png`.

Offline HTTP, reducer, image-boundary and egui interaction tests cover these
paths. The demo includes a synthetic group. No live group was edited, left, or
muted, and normal-account service interoperability remains unverified.

## Embed image galleries — September 11, 2026

Consecutive same-URL image embeds now share one native card: two columns, with a
tall left image and stacked right images for three items. Image-only continuations
and repeated card metadata are grouped; distinct metadata, missing/different URLs,
videos and thumbnail-only entries remain separate. All retained images use the
existing bounded, credential-free preview path and explicit external-open confirmation.

The single-image wire fields are documented in the
[message resource](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/main/developers/resources/message.mdx).
Same-URL gallery behavior is implementation evidence from a
[Discord API repository discussion](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/3253),
not a documented normal-user compatibility guarantee. Offline egui tests cover
grouping, suppression, tile geometry and individual image actions. Live Discord
interoperability and native screenshot inspection remain unverified.

## Existing DM calls — September 11, 2026

Viewing a supported one-to-one DM requests its call state using the existing unofficial
Gateway opcode 13. CALL_CREATE/UPDATE keep an ongoing-call banner independently of ringing
or local media; CALL_DELETE/unavailability removes it. Join never rings an already known
call. [Primary implementation evidence and owner-controlled live checks](voice.md) distinguish
the passing local WebSocket/reducer/UI tests from still-unverified Discord discovery and audio.

## Own profile editing — September 11, 2026

The native editor updates global display name, bio, pronouns and accent color through
the unofficial normal-user `PATCH /users/@me` route, then verifies a fresh global
profile read. Only deliberate changed fields are sent; failures remain visible and
uncertain saves require reload. Mock HTTP and reducer/UI tests pass; no live profile
was read or changed. Avatar/banner uploads, username, guild profiles and security
settings remain outside this editor. Sources, limits and reproduction are in
[profiles.md](profiles.md#editing-your-profile--september-11-2026).

## Outgoing screen sharing — September 11, 2026

The standard build adds macOS 14+ ScreenCaptureKit and Windows Graphics Capture senders for an existing connected DM/server voice call. Share opens a native egui source/settings dialog first. It exposes 720p/1080p and 15/30/60 fps to all accounts, plus cursor visibility; only the explicit Share screen action creates a stream. No subscription fields are changed. Camera video, receiving streams and system/desktop audio remain unsupported.

Gateway opcodes 18/19 and STREAM_CREATE/STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE/STREAM_DELETE are unofficial normal-user behavior, checked against [discord.py-self](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/gateway.py). A separate RTC connection uses the stream RTC server/channel IDs and the parent call session, sharing one ephemeral DAVE signing identity. The `rtc_server_id - 1` MLS group mapping comes from [discord-native-voice](https://github.com/dolfies/discord-native-voice/blob/master/discord/ext/native_voice/stream_client.py); it is not an official protocol guarantee. H264 negotiation and UDP transport are required; mismatches fail visibly. Video is DAVE-encrypted before RFC 6184 packetization and per-packet transport AEAD. There is no plaintext fallback. [DAVE protocol](https://github.com/discord/dave-protocol/blob/main/protocol.md) supplies the encryption requirement.

Screen source discovery and capture occur off the UI/audio threads. Application-owned source lists are capped at 64 labels of 256 bytes. Raw BGRA frames are capped at 3840×2160/33,177,600 bytes; macOS requests the selected output dimensions. Windows prechecks source size and stops on oversized callback frames, but its upstream driver adapter can resize its native GPU pool before that callback. One raw and one encoded frame can be queued; H264 frames are capped at 2 MiB, encrypted packetization at 2,048 fragments of at most 1,200 transport bytes. Quality presets target 4–16 Mbps, with frame dropping under load. They are limits/targets, not measured delivery guarantees.

Stop, call teardown, changed generation, lost video permission or stream-server replacement stop capture and transport. New sharing waits for native worker retirement and matching STREAM_DELETE. No automatic retry or recording is performed. Rekeying pauses capture readiness, drains queued encoded frames, and requires an IDR before resuming transmission. The encoder requests periodic IDRs every two seconds of encoded frames. This initial sender has no RTCP PLI/NACK handling, RTX, congestion adaptation or system-audio capture; lossy-network quality and service acceptance of high-quality presets remain unverified.

Owner-operated validation is still required: allow screen-recording permission, join a private call, choose a window, verify viewing in the official client, then test Stop, source closure, permission loss, viewer changes/rekey and both quality presets. No live account/capture was used for agent tests. Native Windows execution and live Discord video interoperability are not established by macOS builds or synthetic tests.


User context actions (checked September 11, 2026): Close DM uses the documented
[Delete/Close Channel route](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/channel#deleteclose-channel)
only for a known one-to-one DM. It closes navigation after successful HTTP completion;
messages and drafts are not deleted. Pending messages and an active call prevent closing.
Block/unblock use `PUT` (type 2)/`DELETE /users/@me/relationships/{user}`; mute/unmute use
`PATCH /users/@me/guilds/@me/settings` with a single channel override. These account routes are
unofficial and unstable, supported by the public [HTTP implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py)
and [channel settings implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/settings.py).
Mute means DM notifications until explicitly unmuted, not voice audio. The response must confirm
the requested channel and mute value. Block state hydrates from READY relationships and follows
relationship add/update/remove events, based on the public [gateway implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py).
Unknown relationship/settings state is distinguished from false. One write is pending at a time;
rejections, disconnects and ambiguous outcomes remain visible without automatic retries.
Gateway updates take precedence over late HTTP confirmations. Notification suppression reuses
the existing account settings and rejects alerts from known blocked authors. Existing timeline
content is retained; this does not implement Discord's collapsed blocked-message presentation.
Offline reducer, decoder and local HTTP tests cover these actions; normal-user acceptance,
cross-device behavior and native interaction remain live-unverified. No accounts were accessed.

Inline spoilers (September 10): Discord's [Spoiler Tags help](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags)
documents paired pipe delimiters and exempts code blocks. The native timeline recognizes
bounded paired literal delimiters outside code, with up to 32 independently revealed text
regions. Hidden spans create a keyboard-focusable reveal control rather than hidden text,
links, references or emoji widgets. Spoiler attachments/cards keep a separate media reveal;
reply previews remain conservatively concealed. Parser limits use conservative concealment
instead of exposing uncertain source. This is a local Markdown subset, not full Discord parsing
parity; native accessibility and live rendering equivalence remain unverified.

Incoming typing (September 10): Discord's [Typing Start event](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#typing-start)
documents channel/user IDs and a Unix-seconds timestamp. The decoder accepts only these fields
within 16 KiB and discards optional guild/member metadata; invalid signals are ignored. The
desktop retains at most eight current-conversation users for at most ten seconds, rejects old
timestamps and more than five seconds of future skew, and clears state on navigation, messages
from that author, disconnect and access/session changes. Names come only from existing DM,
People or timeline state; missing identities use a generic label. Signals never cause profile
requests, outgoing typing, subscriptions, storage writes or timeline re-layout. A separate
eight-slot lossy inbox preserves reliable-event capacity; duplicate/burst wakeups are bounded
to eight per two seconds. The UI schedules only the next visible expiry, with no dot animation.
Existing People typing subscriptions are unchanged; guild delivery may depend on that pane's
subscription. Service availability and normal-account acceptance remain live-unverified.

Unsupported ordinary-message content (September 10): the [Discord message resource](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message)
documents poll, sticker_items, deprecated stickers, components and IS_COMPONENTS_V2 (1 << 15).
The decoder now preserves only independent presence markers for these sources through full
messages, absent/null partial updates and bounded local cache reloads. It keeps no poll answer,
sticker or component payload. Native static Poll/Sticker/Components placeholders accompany any
supported text/media and share one confirmed Open in Discord action. This implements recognition
and a fallback, not poll voting, sticker rendering or interactive components. Old cache rows
cannot recover metadata previously discarded and gain markers during ordinary history refresh.
The local decoder caps arrays at 100 objects, each direct object at 64 fields, within the existing
4 MiB wire limit; these are application bounds, not Discord quotas. Native/live behavior remains
unverified; the source documentation does not establish normal-account API acceptance.

External fallback (September 10): unsupported channel rows and message placeholders offer
Open in Discord through an explicit browser confirmation. URLs use the fixed Discord HTTPS
origin and typed guild/channel/message IDs; DMs use @me with the conversation ID. No content,
names, credentials or signed media URLs enter the route. Zero IDs, missing DM/guild identity
and unavailable view permission disable the action. Discord's [message-link help](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID)
documents linking to an accessible message/conversation; its [Trust and Safety example](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000159602-How-to-Properly-Report-People-On-Discord)
shows the guild and @me path structure on the older discordapp.com domain. The current
discord.com route is an integration assumption, not a new API guarantee. Headless tests cover
construction and explicit confirmation; native launch, browser account selection and destination
resolution remain owner-unverified. The browser uses its own session and Discord authorization.

Loaded threads (September 10): READY guild thread arrays follow the original [discord.py-self guild parser](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/guild.py); active create/update/delete, scoped sync, archive eviction and owner-removal handling are informed by its [dispatch implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py). Discord's [Gateway thread events](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#thread-list-sync) document the guild/parent scope and membership fields. These primary sources establish wire evidence, not normal-account acceptance; no implementation blocks were copied. Active discovery is limited to service-supplied snapshots/events; explicit archive reads are described below, with existing subscriptions unchanged. Unknown updates do not hydrate a missing thread. See [native navigation scope](categories.md).

Serein is unofficial and not endorsed by Discord. No normal-user live session has been tested. Technical compatibility does not imply approval. Discord forbids normal-account automation outside its OAuth2/bot API and warns of account termination ([policy](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-User-Accounts-Self-Bots)); its [terms](https://discord.com/terms) also apply.

| Logout | Local credential/task disposal; OAuth revocation applies only to OAuth tokens | Local behavior implemented; remote session revocation unverified | Local logout only, does not delete sent messages or claim server token revocation |

`messages.read` refers to local RPC; it is not a general REST chat grant. `rpc` needs approved-partner access and depends on the official application. Social SDK relationship access does not establish general desktop-client chat access. No client secret, token broker, fingerprint imitation, native password endpoint, CAPTCHA/MFA workaround, or harvested QR flow is implemented. The owner explicitly requested the official login page in an authentication-only webview and secure saved login; OAuth is not the product login.

Discord states DAVE is required for the listed call types from March 1, 2026. libdave supplies encryption components, not capture, playback, codecs, jitter handling, or a complete call engine. No legacy unencrypted fallback is acceptable.

All implemented network features remain **experimental and live-unverified** until the manual gate in authentication.md passes. Public bot documentation is protocol evidence, not proof of normal-user acceptance. Abaddon was inspected for wire evidence only; no GPL source is copied into this dual-licensed implementation.

September 10 continuation: Gateway documentation was rechecked for heartbeat, Resume and invalid-session handling. Offline coverage now includes a real loopback WebSocket lifecycle, including non-resumable invalidation and credential-expiry close; no Discord connection was made. The localhost dial override is compiled only into unit tests and never changes production/resume origin validation. Native formatting, font glyph coverage and persisted appearance have offline tests; these do not expand the live-verified capability set.

## Authentication evidence and changed requirements

The owner superseded the initial storage/login constraints during implementation: official-login webview, saved OS credential-store token, and subsequently bounded local SQLite caches/drafts are now required/allowed. SPEC.md records the final policy.

[Discord Userdoccers’ original protocol research](https://docs.discord.food/authentication), checked 2026-09-09, describes normal-user password login, MFA tickets, and authentication tokens. It is unofficial evidence, not Discord approval. The final implementation delegates that login to Discord’s hosted UI instead of implementing these endpoints itself. Email/phone login, QR, TOTP, CAPTCHA, passkeys and device verification are offered only as the official page permits in the platform engine; none was tested with a real account here.

The handoff is original code in `crates/platform/src/login-handoff.js`. It observes an Authorization header only for this temporary webview’s own `https://discord.com/api/v*/` requests, after user-controlled authentication. It reads neither localStorage nor other applications, profiles or tabs, and does not inspect passwords or QR secrets. A random per-webview capability scopes the IPC handoff; Rust validates that capability, the IPC origin, and token length, then verifies the account via `/users/@me` and rejects bot accounts. This handoff is a technical hypothesis with offline tests; Discord’s current page may use an unsupported transport, reject the embedded engine, or change its behavior. Failure must not be called successful login.

Navigation is limited to Discord’s HTTPS origin; new windows and downloads are blocked. Third-party challenge subframes are left to the platform engine; popup-dependent methods may fail. No spoofed official client user agent/properties are supplied. Resume URLs are restricted to recognized Discord gateway hosts.

September 10 People/avatar continuation: the member subscription uses the opcode 14 shape found in the current original discord.py-self implementation. [Original lazy-guild research](https://arandomnewaccount.gitlab.io/discord-unofficial-docs/lazy_guilds.html) describes list positions including groups and ambiguous empty SYNC responses; it is unofficial evidence, not a service guarantee. A newer opcode 37 has also been [reported by Userdoccers](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers/issues/191); Serein does not claim opcode 14 works for every account. Channel-specific list identities require the available everyone-role permissions and channel overwrites. The small noncryptographic Murmur3 identity calculation is implemented locally and checked against known vectors; no third-party client code blocks were copied. This identity selects a list; it grants no permissions. No complete member directory is fetched or persisted. Profile cards expose only available name, ID and avatar, not invented bios, roles or relationships. Server-specific custom avatars and full profile endpoints remain unsupported.

## DM voice evidence — September 10

Normal-user DM entry uses guild_id:null with main Gateway opcodes 13/4, based on the original [discord.py-self Gateway implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/gateway.py). CALL_CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE and voice state/server shapes follow its [dispatch source](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py) and [voice types](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/types/voice.py). Ring/stop-ringing use the [HTTP implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py); its [DM connect flow](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/channel.py) establishes voice before ringing. These are unofficial interoperability evidence, not approved normal-account APIs or a bot-token workaround. No source-code blocks were copied.

Discord's documented voice transport and [DAVE protocol](https://daveprotocol.com/) supply encryption/protocol requirements. Serein uses Davey 0.1.4/OpenMLS, an unofficial implementation, rather than claiming to ship Discord's libdave or an independently audited engine. Real MLS, DAVE, RTP, Opus and loopback WebSocket/UDP tests exercise the adapter with synthetic participants. They do not verify current Discord acceptance, microphone permission, device quality or a remote official client. Existing group DMs, Stage channels and camera video remain unsupported; outgoing screen sharing is covered by the September 11 addendum. Guild voice is implemented separately below, with its live gate still unverified. See [voice scope and owner-operated gate](voice.md) and [adapter details](../crates/discord-voice/README.md).

Image attachments: documented wire metadata and spoiler bit 3 are implemented; additional sensitive flags and proxy PNG conversion rely on unofficial implementation evidence. Native viewing and bounded cache/patch behavior have offline coverage; actual account image delivery remains unverified. [Scope and sources](chat-images.md).

Read-state continuation (September 10): channel read cursors and latest-message IDs drive boolean unread badges; absent service read state remains unknown. The message menu sends one acknowledgement only after an explicit action on a loaded message in a fresh authenticated view. No scroll-triggered acknowledgement, mention-counter rewriting, bulk acknowledgements or outgoing mark-unread action is implemented. Incoming manual mark-unread updates are honored. A later Gateway update wins over an in-flight HTTP completion. Snapshot/update lists are capped at 4000 entries, retained cursors are limited to known navigation channels, and only one write is pending. A legacy acknowledgement token, if supplied, is capped at 2048 bytes in zeroized session memory; the response body is capped at 4096 bytes. Neither cursors nor acknowledgement tokens are written to SQLite. The linked primary client implementation supplies unofficial wire evidence; local HTTP/WebSocket fixtures do not establish Discord acceptance.

Search continuation (September 10): guild conversations use the guild search route with an exact channel filter; DMs use the channel route. Search content is percent-encoded, with timestamp-descending order and explicit max_id pagination. One replaceable task uses existing REST permits, deadlines and cooldowns. Indexing responses require another deliberate Search action after the service delay; no automatic polling, broad account search, advanced filters, NSFW override or search-result persistence is implemented. Service totals and partial-index status are displayed as supplied, not asserted complete. Opening a result fetches up to 50 history messages ending at that ID and positions the timeline there; unavailable results are reported. Existing reload returns to latest history. Search snapshots are cleared on relevant edits/deletes, navigation, disconnect, permission invalidation and logout. Original-client sources supply wire evidence only; no source-code blocks were copied and no authenticated service request was used as validation.

Login compatibility correction (September 10): READY read_state accepts both the legacy array and the versioned entries/version/partial object, under the same 4000-entry bound. Serein's Identify does not request the versioned_read_states capability; rejecting the legacy shape previously rejected the entire login payload. The capability's effect is described in the original [discord.py-self capability definitions](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/flags.py), rechecked September 10. Partial snapshots leave omitted channels unknown. Identify capabilities remain unchanged. Static error labels distinguish account verification, Gateway discovery, READY decoding and connection setup without exposing payloads, credentials or remote error text. Synthetic regression and loopback evidence do not establish actual account login success.

## Reaction refresh and pinned messages - September 10

Reaction readback now uses a history request with limit=1 and around=the exact message ID, matching the current normal-user [discord.py-self get_message implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py). The prior single-message GET can reject normal-user sessions; its Forbidden result caused the existing channel-invalidation policy to clear the conversation. Exactly one matching channel/message record is accepted. Missing targets, neighboring messages and malformed/oversized-count replies leave reaction state unavailable without substituting content. Genuine Forbidden history responses still revoke the channel and its cached history. No write is automatically retried.

Pinned-message browsing uses GET /channels/{channel}/messages/pins?limit=25, following [Discord's Get Channel Pins reference](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message#get-channel-pins) and the primary normal-user implementation's [pins_from request](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py) and [pin iterator](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/abc.py), rechecked September 10. Older pages send the last pin's timestamp as the ISO8601 before cursor, independently of message IDs. Nanosecond precision is retained; each page must advance in pin order. Pages replace the previous 25-item snapshot, with explicit Older pins, Retry older pins after failure, and Reload to newest. Returned has_more controls continuation; no complete/stable listing is promised while remote pins change. Summaries remain text-only with concealed spoilers. No pin/unpin mutation, background polling or automatic acknowledgement is implemented. Open message revalidates normal history. Search, pins and archives share one cancellable task/result slot; none of these snapshots is persisted. No owner-controlled live service test has validated these changes.

## Single-file uploads - September 10

The selected file is uploaded only after Send. Serein requests a staging target with authenticated `POST /channels/{channel}/attachments`, using `files:[{id:"0",filename,file_size}]`; streams a credential-free PUT to its `upload_url`; then creates a message with `attachments:[{id:"0",filename,uploaded_filename}]`. Existing content, reply, explicit mention allowlists and nonce correlation are preserved, including attachment-only messages. This sequence follows the primary [HTTP implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/http.py#L1073), [route](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/http.py#L1527) and [file serialization](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/file.py#L197), inspected at commit `2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4`. No implementation source was copied. Public bot multipart examples do not verify this normal-user path.

Only `https://discord-attachments-uploads-prd.storage.googleapis.com` on effective port 443 is accepted. This exact origin was independently observed in the public `Content-Security-Policy` returned by unauthenticated `curl.exe --silent --head https://discord.com/app` on September 10. Userinfo, fragments and redirects are rejected; signed path/query values remain opaque, bounded and unlogged. A separate HTTP client sends neither Discord authorization nor cookies to storage. Test-only loopback origins are absent from shipped builds.

The local limit is **one nonempty regular file, at most 20,000,000 bytes**. This is Serein's conservative cap, not an inferred account entitlement. Discord's [File Attachments FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/25444343291031-File-Attachments-FAQ), updated August 13, 2026, states a 20 MB free upload limit and larger paid limits; server permissions, experiments and rejections remain authoritative. Serein does not detect paid limits or compress/rewrite files.

Application chunks are at most 64 KiB; negotiation and storage responses at most 64 KiB, signed URLs 4096 bytes, server upload names 1024 bytes, local paths 4096 encoded bytes and filenames 256 UTF-8 bytes. One upload job uses latest-value progress, not an expanding event queue. The PUT has a 300-second overall deadline, 10-second connection timeout and 30-second read timeout. Filesystem work stays outside rendering.

Path and open-file size/modification metadata are checked before transfer and again before message creation. Missing or observably changed files fail explicitly. These checks are not an immutable snapshot or a defense against a writer restoring identical metadata; no hidden recovery copy is created. Cancellation before message creation prevents the message POST, but staged bytes already sent may remain remotely; Serein does not claim remote deletion or a retention deadline. Cancellation after message POST begins reports an unknown outcome. No transfer or message write is automatically retried. Signed upload targets and local source paths are session-only.

Synthetic tests cover actual loopback HTTP, credential isolation, redirects, file bounds/changes, cancellation during PUT and cancellation during message creation. They do not establish normal-user interoperability: an owner-controlled developer-session test with an official-client recipient remains required. Multiple attachments, tier-dependent larger files and remote staging cleanup remain unimplemented.

File selection also accepts one native file dropped into the active conversation window. The pinned egui 0.36.2 DroppedFileHandle exposes a path; Serein moves the event handles, accepts only one absolute path within the existing path limit, and never invokes their whole-file bytes API. Drops reuse the picker validation and cancellation slot. They cannot replace an existing selection or active operation and never start an upload themselves. Unsupported/multiple drops and unavailable conversation states report an error. A composer hover hint explains the limit and explicit Send behavior. Native OS drag/drop delivery remains unverified; synthetic handle admission and late-result isolation are tested.

Archived-thread browsing (September 10): [Discord public/private/joined-private archive endpoints](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/channel#list-public-archived-threads) describe public and private pages ordered by archive timestamp with an ISO8601 before cursor; joined-private pages use descending thread IDs and a snowflake cursor. The primary normal-user implementation exposes the [same three HTTP routes](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py) and [channel archive selection](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/channel.py). These sources supply wire evidence, not live account acceptance. Serein makes only explicit GET requests, limits each page to 25 entries, checks archived metadata, guild/parent/type, duplicates and cursor progress, and ignores member summaries. Public/private timestamps preserve nanoseconds. Private archive enumeration requires the service permissions described by Discord, including MANAGE_THREADS; joined-private is a separate choice. Open loads history without a join/reopen mutation. No live account was used to validate these routes.

### Unicode emoji artwork (September 10, 2026)

Formatted messages (including existing formatted embed/search surfaces), Unicode reaction
counts and the reaction menu use bundled [Twemoji 17.0.3](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji/releases/tag/v17.0.3)
artwork from Twitter and contributors, under CC BY 4.0. This is a local rendering feature,
not a new protocol endpoint or proof of matching Discord's current artwork revision.
Grapheme matching supports flags, modifiers, keycaps and ZWJ sequences, including optional
emoji presentation selectors. Code, explicit text-presentation and unknown sequences remain
literal. Original message/reaction strings and outgoing requests are unchanged. Whole-message
Copy preserves the original text; drag-selection of rendered text excludes inline image widgets.
The editable composer continues to use native font text. Custom server emoji and animation
are not supplied by Twemoji and retain their existing text fallback. Validation is synthetic;
no live Discord session was used.

### Custom server emoji, chat picker and copying (September 10, 2026)

The current server's catalog is received from READY and known-guild GUILD_CREATE, updated
by GUILD_EMOJIS_UPDATE, and cleared on GUILD_DELETE. The documented emoji fields and update
shape are supported by [Emoji Resource](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/emoji)
and [Gateway Events](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#guild-emojis-update).
Normal-user READY remains unofficial/unstable; this change was tested with synthetic events
and local sockets, not a live account. Joining new guilds' full navigation remains pre-existing
unsupported behavior. Missing catalogs are displayed as unavailable rather than empty.

Formatted message/profile/embed text renders `<:name:id>` and `<a:name:id>` as static CDN
images, using the documented [custom emoji CDN endpoint](https://docs.discord.com/developers/reference#image-formatting-cdn-endpoints).
Custom reactions use the same bounded media worker. Deleted/failing previews have a fixed
placeholder and retain copyable original markup. Standard Unicode and custom image widgets
participate in text selection: copying a selection retains Unicode sequences/custom markup,
and right-click Copy emoji copies the entire token. Selection endpoints treat each image as
one item, avoiding broken ZWJ sequences or partial custom markup. Whole-message Copy is unchanged.

The chat Emoji button opens a searchable Unicode/name palette and current-server tab. Choosing
inserts at the saved text cursor or replaces its selection, preserves Unicode presentation
selectors, and records the draft without sending. Escape/close restores keyboard focus.
Only catalog entries explicitly available, unmanaged and unrestricted by roles are enabled;
unknown eligibility remains disabled. Cross-server/DM catalog selection and full role/Nitro
entitlement inference are not implemented; the service remains authoritative for actual sends.
Animated emoji are inserted with their original animated markup and shown as still previews.
The composer now displays known user mentions as `@name`, Unicode as bundled Twemoji, and custom emoji as static server artwork, while retaining original wire text for editing/copy/send. Unresolved user IDs remain literal; unavailable server artwork shows its name.


## Server voice — September 10, 2026

Guild voice entry uses the documented [Gateway voice state update and voice allocation flow](https://docs.discord.com/developers/topics/voice-connections): guild-scoped join/mute/leave, matching owner session plus guild server update, and guild ID as voice Identify/Resume server ID. The DAVE group remains identified by channel ID. This protocol documentation is not approval or live evidence for normal-user accounts. Server channel rosters use READY, GUILD_CREATE, VOICE_STATE_UPDATE and unofficial READY_SUPPLEMENTAL/PASSIVE_UPDATE_V2 shapes from the original [discord.py-self dispatcher](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py).

The media engine extends the existing DAVE/Opus path to bounded group membership and simultaneous remote audio mixing. Server mute/deafen gates local media. Empty rooms wait without opening audio devices; microphone capture requires an established encrypted group. Stage channels and group DMs remain visibly unsupported. Main Gateway disconnect, channel/session moves, permission invalidation or voice server migration stop the current media session and require deliberate rejoin. No automatic call or DM ringing is triggered by viewing a roster or joining a guild channel.

The implementation is tested with synthetic protocol/crypto/UI data. The owner-controlled official-client two-way audio, multi-party join/leave, permission, device and network tests in [voice.md](voice.md) remain required before claiming working live interoperability.

### Server people subscription repair (September 10, 2026)

The member pane previously sent deprecated opcode 14 with `typing:false`. Current
[Gateway implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/gateway.py)
and [channel subscription prerequisites](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py)
show opcode 37 and a guild typing subscription before requesting channel member ranges.
Serein now enables that subscription only for the active member pane and clears it with
channel ranges when the pane closes or navigation changes. This receives typing events;
it does not send typing notifications. Incoming typing for the selected conversation is
handled as described below; other conversations' typing is discarded.
The request still covers only positions 0–99, with the existing 128-KiB retained member
budget, request/list identity filtering and timeout. No full-directory fetch was added.

A read-only observation of the owner's already-open app confirmed an unavailable pane
with a nonzero server total. That is reproduction evidence, not successful validation of
this repaired build. Tests use a synthetic local WebSocket; normal-user acceptance of the
new request remains unverified. Role display is **not implemented**: only role permissions
for list identity are read; member role IDs, group headings and role colors are discarded.
Role administration is outside the product scope.


## Channel visibility and history revocation - September 10, 2026

The documented [CHANNEL_OBFUSCATED flag](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/channel#obfuscated-channels)
(bit 17 / 131072), described in the [obfuscation change log](https://docs.discord.com/developers/change-log#channel-obfuscation-for-users-and-bots),
is authoritative for this path. Placeholder names are not permission evidence. READY omits flagged
channels and threads under flagged parents; an independently visible child of an obfuscated category
remains visible. CHANNEL_CREATE/UPDATE and guild channel snapshots revoke flagged IDs through the
existing removal path. Thread create/update/archive admission follows the same flag boundary.
Raw navigation item and duplicate-ID limits apply before filtering. Thread sync carries explicit
hidden-ID removals in the same bounded event, including a currently browsed archived thread;
ordinary absence from an active-thread snapshot still preserves that archived view.

An unflagged guild CHANNEL_UPDATE with a valid ID, type and name can restore missing navigation
only for an already loaded guild. Optional flags, position and parent fields need not be present.
Existing channels still receive absent/null-aware patches; restoration does not replace their
omitted fields, rejoin voice or accept an old history result. Incomplete updates wait for a full
update or READY. No guild identity is guessed from an obfuscated payload.

Accepted READY replaces the readable navigation set and cancels prior history requests. Reload
requires a currently loaded text channel, as do HTTP results and disk-cache hydration. Revocation
clears the active view and ends affected voice state; restoration requires deliberate selection or
join. Voice allowances and guild roster snapshots exclude obfuscated channels.
This closes explicit visibility and stale-response paths, not the full role/overwrite permission
mirror. Service permission failures remain authoritative; normal-user live behavior is unverified.

## Permission-aware actions (September 10, 2026)

The session now mirrors the current account's guild owner, roles, self-member role IDs and
timeout, and channel role/self overwrites. Unknown metadata is distinct from a known zero-bit
result and cannot enable guild actions. Owner/administrator bypass, everyone then combined
role then self overwrites, and timeout restrictions follow the documented
[permission calculation](https://docs.discord.com/developers/topics/permissions).
Threads use their loaded text/announcement/forum/media parent's overwrites and
SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS; category overwrites are not recursively applied to children.
Existing DM/group-DM text access remains service-authoritative without guild metadata.

READY and known-guild GUILD_CREATE install bounded snapshots. Role create/update/delete,
self GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE, owner and channel overwrite updates replace the relevant metadata;
READY_SUPPLEMENTAL and PASSIVE_UPDATE_V2 can update already supplied self-member data.
No full member request or new subscription is added. Normal-user evidence is pinned to
[READY merged members](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/state.py#L1731),
[guild owner properties](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/guild.py#L691),
and [member updates](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/member.py#L375),
plus the [documented member event](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#guild-member-update).
These are wire references, not live account acceptance or a guarantee of event delivery.
Absent incremental fields preserve known state; explicit null makes roles/overwrites/owner
unknown or clears a timeout. A full self-member snapshot without a timeout means no timeout.

Shared command/UI checks cover sending, attachment selection/drop/upload, own-message editing
and deletion, reactions, history/search/pins/archive reads, and voice admission/capture.
VIEW without READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY permits fresh live messages and separately authorized sends,
but cannot fetch, seed or persist history. Permission loss clears the affected loaded view,
pending reads, result pages and reply target; late content cannot restore it. Recovery drafts
remain. Read restoration requires deliberate reload/reselection. New reactions require
ADD_REACTIONS; an existing emoji can be added without that bit, with history and timeout checks.
Removing one's existing reaction remains separate. Private archive enumeration additionally
requires MANAGE_THREADS. Voice CONNECT permits listen-only joining; SPEAK gates capture;
without USE_VAD, focused push-to-talk must be enabled and held. Restoration never rejoins.

Discord remains authoritative for action rejection, private-thread membership, account emoji
entitlements and delivery of permission updates. Role names/colors, role administration,
moderating other users' messages, new guild joining, and full member-directory synchronization
are outside this slice. Synthetic parser, localhost transport and reducer/UI guard tests do
not establish live compatibility. Native automation remains paused after owner Escape stops;
no live account action, microphone capture or new native screenshot was performed.

## Composer and notifications — September 10, 2026

See [notifications](notifications.md) for service badge/read-state reconciliation, focused
view ACKs, session-only native opt-in and fail-closed mute/DND handling. READY read-state
counts, settings and session presence use isolated unofficial normal-user wire shapes.
Synthetic protocol/UI tests are not live Discord validation. Role/everyone mention events and silent flags are handled through bounded supplied metadata
and current self roles/settings; see notifications.md for conservative classification and
live limits. Blocked relationships and complete protobuf notification preferences remain
unsupported.


### Loaded People presence (September 10, 2026)

The open guild People pane consumes standalone PRESENCE_UPDATE for users in its current
100-row subscription mirror. [Discord's presence event](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#presence-update)
documents partial user objects and online/idle/dnd/offline status. The pinned normal-user
[dispatcher](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/state.py#L2040)
allows an optional guild scope. Serein ignores guildless updates and does not request a
friends/global directory or additional subscription flags. These are primary wire references,
not proof that a normal-user account receives these updates through this client's subscription.

Absent status preserves the known value; explicit null or unknown strings clear it to
Presence unavailable. Online, Away, Do not disturb and Offline are service-reported labels;
Offline does not distinguish an invisible user. Custom activity type 4 is normalized using the
same parser as member snapshots: at most 128 characters / 512 UTF-8 bytes, with optional Unicode
emoji and no controls. Omitted activities preserve known custom text; null, empty or no custom
activity clears it. These absent/null choices are defensive client policy, not a documented
normal-user delivery guarantee. Other activities, partial profiles and device status are
discarded; the existing subscription still sends activities=false. Bursts coalesce within a fixed 100-ms window; stale request/session/access
updates cannot modify the pane. Self-session DND notification suppression keeps its separate
existing path. Synthetic localhost Gateway, reducer and headless UI tests supply local evidence;
normal-account delivery and native screenshots remain owner-controlled validation gates.


### Keyboard conversation navigation (September 10, 2026)

Find conversation / Ctrl+K (Command+K) is a local picker over existing loaded navigation and
current VIEW decisions. It adds no Discord route, subscription or relationship lookup. Selection
reuses the same history/roster path as the sidebar, including cancellation and service-authoritative
permission failures. A voice result only opens the roster and does not join. The query is session
UI state and never enters message content, REST requests or SQLite. Headless keyboard/IME checks
are synthetic; real platform input, screen readers and live navigation remain unverified.

## September 10: native system-message descriptions

Discord's [documented message type IDs](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message#message-types) were checked on 2026-09-10. The decoder now retains the type through REST/Gateway messages and the local history cache. The timeline describes joins/welcomes, recipient changes, calls, channel name/icon changes, pins, boosts/tiers, channel follows, discovery notices, threads, invite reminders, AutoMod, subscriptions/offers, Stage events, incident alerts, purchases and poll results. Original content/embeds/attachments still render separately. Copy and loaded reply previews include the description. Unknown types keep an explicit placeholder; legacy cached unsupported rows remain unknown until history revalidation.

These are native textual descriptions, not full interactive cards or proof of normal-user protocol compatibility. Call outcome/duration, subscription details, missing thread content and poll votes are not inferred. Search/pins snapshot excerpts remain their existing content-only previews; opening a hit loads the described timeline message. No live account, call or microphone validation was performed. Open PR #27 adds the external fallback and #28 adds unsupported payload markers; neither implemented these descriptions. Integration must retain their controls/markers without restoring a generic system placeholder for recognized types.


### Reply targets (2026-09-10)

[Discord's message reference documentation](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message#message-reference-structure)
distinguishes an absent referenced_message (unknown) from explicit null (deleted), and supplies
channel IDs on received references. This client accepts navigation for type 19 replies and type
23 context-menu message references only, with default reference type 0, the same channel and a
positive earlier message ID. Crossposts, forwards, thread-parent references and unknown reference
shapes stay non-navigable, retaining their system description or unsupported fallback. Nested original bodies are discarded with a
bounded object visitor rather than recursively hydrated. One existing history page before
target+1 retrieves an unloaded original; there is no bulk search or background traversal.
This is public protocol evidence, not proof of normal-user endpoint acceptance. Live validation
is unperformed; offline regressions cover reference shape, missing/null data and deletion races.


### Server member identity after hydration (September 10, 2026)

A guild refresh triggered by subscribing can recreate channel navigation objects without
the READY-only member-list ID. Member requests now compute that ID from the existing
bounded role/overwrite mirror, so GUILD_CREATE, newly delivered/restored channels and
Reload people use current metadata. A change in list identity retires the active request
and lets the visible pane request again; unchanged metadata preserves pending replies.
Missing metadata still means unavailable; threads retain their separate-protocol limitation.
The shared hash accepts the same u128 permission values as the permission parser.

The original [subscription lifecycle](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/state.py)
and [list identity algorithm](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/abc.py)
were rechecked. This changes local identity selection, not the opcode, requested ranges,
permissions or account access. Synthetic regression tests establish the hydration bug
and its repair, not acceptance by Discord; owner-operated live verification remains unrun.


### Member list row headers and refresh bursts (September 10, 2026)

The original [Gateway wire types](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/2ba64a9a997e151a9c259984e0a179b1fdf4aff4/discord/types/gateway.py)
distinguish top-level group summaries (ID plus count) from group items inside SYNC ranges
(ID only). Serein incorrectly required a count in every group item, rejecting the complete
member update. It now reads only the group ID needed to recognize an index placeholder;
counts are not fabricated. An exact synthetic ID-only-header regression loads the following
member at the correct position. The owner-run redacted trace confirms that member replies
were rejected by the decoder; the owner subsequently confirmed the repaired list loads.

GUILD_CREATE can emit a synchronous channel-navigation burst. The previous eight-item
reliable queue could terminate the session before the UI drained it. Admission now shares
the same 32 MiB estimated byte budget across up to 4,008 events, preserving FIFO order,
per-item limits and failure on real exhaustion. Full-burst/byte-exhaustion/cleanup tests
are synthetic; this does not promise every large account fits existing account budgets.

The owner confirmed the affected server member list loads after restarting the repaired
diagnostic build on September 10, 2026. This does not establish general live compatibility
or long-running capacity behavior.

### Member role display

The active server member pane groups loaded online members by their highest hoisted role,
then shows ungrouped Online and Offline sections. Heading counts cover loaded members, not
the entire server; the existing partial-list hint remains. Highest nonzero role color sets
online names independently of the hoisted role. Offline names remain muted. Unknown roles
fall back to ordinary names/groups. Role changes/removals reuse the live permission mirror,
and member list SYNC/UPDATE supplies role membership. No directory fetch was added.

Role name, position, hoist and primary color are documented fields in
[Discord's role object](https://docs.discord.com/developers/topics/permissions#role-object).
Modern `colors.primary_color` takes precedence over legacy `color`; role gradients are not
rendered. Equal positions favor the lower role ID, consistent with
[discord.py role comparison](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/discord/role.py).
Names retain hue when readable; the theme adjusts insufficient contrast, including hover.
Member list subscriptions remain unofficial. Synthetic role evidence does not establish
live role behavior for every account.


### Authorized message deletion - September 10, 2026

A loaded guild message can be deleted after explicit confirmation when its author is the current
user or the current effective channel permissions include MANAGE_MESSAGES. Others' DM/group-DM
messages are excluded; edit remains author-only. Permission overwrites and thread-parent
inheritance use the existing permission resolver. The confirmation rechecks access; the server
remains authoritative and HTTP rejection/uncertainty does not synthesize successful deletion.

The [official message resource](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message#delete-message)
documents deleting others' guild messages with MANAGE_MESSAGES and lists deletable message types.
Known non-deletable and unknown types are denied locally; automoderation notices require
MANAGE_MESSAGES even when their supplied author matches the user. This is dated protocol evidence,
not proof of normal-user service acceptance. Offline permission/menu/local HTTP tests are synthetic;
no message was deleted on Discord, and native confirmation/screen-reader evidence remains unverified.


## Received rich presence (September 10, 2026)

Activity types and text fields follow the [documented Gateway activity object](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#activity-object).
The existing member-list snapshot and PRESENCE_UPDATE path now retains bounded rich text alongside
custom status. DM presence is admitted only for already-known accessible DM recipients; initial
friend presence from READY/READY_SUPPLEMENTAL and guild-less updates use unofficial normal-user
shapes observed in [discord.py-self's state implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py).
These sources were checked September 10; developer documentation is not proof of normal-user
support. The initial text implementation added no subscription or endpoint; artwork lookup is
described below. No agent-operated account action or live session validation was performed.
The existing guild subscription's `activities` flag stays unchanged: the public implementation's
[subscription reference](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/guild.py)
labels its meaning unknown. Only received activity metadata is displayed; missing events remain
unavailable. Offline status clears activity. Disconnect hides cached DM presence; a successful resume restores it and applies replayed changes. Fresh READY, resync and session reset discard the cache.
Activity actions and elapsed/progress timers remain unsupported.

Startup correction: Identify does not enable `DEDUPE_USER_OBJECTS`, so initial friend presence
arrives in `READY.presences` with `user.id`. The bootstrap now accepts that format as well as
`merged_presences.friends` with `user_id`; both use the same recipient filter and byte/item limits.
The [unofficial READY capability description](https://docs.discord.food/gateway/gateway-events#ready)
documents this format distinction. A synthetic already-running Genshin Impact activity exercises
the missing startup path. This does not verify the owner's reported live payload, change activity
subscriptions, or promote guild-scoped presence into globally authoritative DM presence.

Activity artwork: profile cards show a static image to the left of the text. The decoder prefers
`assets.large_image`, then `small_image` when large is absent, then the application icon. Numeric
assets and `mp:` references follow the [documented activity asset formats](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#activity-object-activity-asset-image)
and [CDN paths](https://docs.discord.com/developers/reference#image-formatting). Media-proxy
references must also pass the existing safe image-loader path restrictions; direct external
URLs and unsupported asset schemes are never fetched. A missing/failed image keeps the text.
Application-only activities use the unauthenticated
[`GET /applications/{id}/rpc` endpoint](https://docs.discord.food/resources/application#get-rpc-application-unauthenticated)
to obtain an icon hash, then the fixed Discord CDN app-icons path. This metadata route is
unofficial; a public sample application returned HTTP 200 without credentials on September 10.
Synthetic decoder, local HTTP, cache and egui tests cover the implementation, not normal-user
artwork interoperability. The owner confirmed presence text after launching the prior build;
new artwork has not been tested against the owner's live session.


### Inline audio attachments (September 11, 2026)

MP3 and PCM WAV attachments have local Play/Pause, seek, time and volume controls.
Preview eligibility accepts a supported filename extension or MIME type, even when
the other metadata disagrees. Audio hints take precedence over image grouping;
the decoder still validates the bytes before playback.
The existing restricted Discord CDN attachment URL validator is reused; signed URLs
are neither logged nor sent with account authorization. Download/Open original remain
available for unsupported formats and clips exceeding preview limits. There is no
new Discord endpoint or voice protocol. The synthetic demo generates a WAV tone even
for its MP3-labeled card; a separate original MP3 fixture checks real MP3 decoding.
Live CDN/account interoperability and native output on other OSes remain unverified.

### Unknown Gateway variants (September 10, 2026)

Unknown dispatches remain ignored without granting capabilities; unsupported opcodes retain the
existing protocol-error behavior. Opt-in `SEREIN_GATEWAY_DIAGNOSTICS=1` now records bounded fixed
categories for these cases and missing dispatch names. Received names and payloads never enter
diagnostics. This changes observability, not the supported service contract. Offline local-socket
checks cover continued message delivery and heartbeat cursor advancement; normal-user service
behavior remains unverified. See storage-policy.md for exact per-run limits and stderr handling.

### Outgoing game IPC Rich Presence (September 11, 2026)

The saved, off-by-default Game Activity setting now hosts a local activity-only IPC endpoint
instead of polling an executable allowlist. It tries `discord-ipc-0` through `discord-ipc-9`
without replacing an occupied endpoint. Windows named pipes and Unix runtime/temp sockets
follow [Discord's RPC transport](https://docs.discord.com/developers/topics/rpc).
Games must connect to Serein; IPC is point-to-point, not an eavesdropping/subscription feed
from an already-running Discord instance. Enable sharing before launching the game; another
Discord client may win the game's connection. Games without IPC integration remain unsupported.

Supported: v1 handshake/READY, SET_ACTIVITY, null or omitted clear, PING/PONG, disconnect cleanup,
name/application ID, activity type, details/state, timestamps and registered large/small artwork.
The newest active game's update wins, with fallback to another connected game when it clears.
Other RPC commands return correlated errors without disconnecting games that subscribe to join
events. Join/spectate actions, secrets, buttons, party actions and game-provided URLs are omitted.
Legacy omitted clears and callback subscriptions are verified against Discord's original
[SDK serializer](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc/blob/master/src/serialization.cpp) and
[SDK runtime](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc/blob/master/src/discord_rpc.cpp).
Timestamps accept legacy seconds and modern milliseconds (as emitted by
[discordjs/RPC](https://github.com/discordjs/RPC/blob/master/src/client.js)); values below 10^10
are interpreted as seconds. This threshold is our contemporary-date heuristic, not a documented
universal conversion rule.

Public `/applications/{id}/rpc` resolves the application name; the unofficial
`/oauth2/applications/{id}/assets` route resolves registered asset keys to IDs, following the
[public HTTP implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py). Both are
credential-free and bounded, with no redirects or automatic retries; Retry-After cooldowns
are shared across the session's metadata lookups. Unresolved artwork is
omitted and application-name lookup failures are visible. These routes and normal-user Gateway
publication remain unofficial/unstable. The existing [Update Presence](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#update-presence)
path waits for READY/RESUMED, coalesces updates and limits attempts (including clears) to one
per five seconds. The Gateway payload retains the existing online/afk/since behavior.

Offline tests cover native Windows IPC, malformed/oversized frames, handshake/update/clear,
unsupported subscriptions, shutdown, rich Gateway fields, rate spacing and reconnect.
Native screenshots use only `--demo`; they demonstrate settings, not IPC or Discord publication.
No live account/game compatibility was tested. Linux/macOS native execution remains unverified
on this Windows host; builds/tests or fixtures do not establish normal-user service compatibility.

Reply-framing correction (September 11, 2026): assemble the header and payload before writing.
The [C# SDK used by osu!](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/blob/master/DiscordRPC/IO/ManagedNamedPipeClient.cs)
parses each completed pipe read as a frame. Against the installed osu! SDK 1.5.0.51,
isolated synthetic Windows pipes decoded 10/10 combined replies and 0/10 split replies;
split replies disconnected even without an artificial delay. A native Rust regression
received only four bytes of a 240-byte READY before the fix and the complete reply after it.
This verifies local framing, not live game-to-Gateway publication. Byte streams do not
guarantee whole-frame delivery universally; this SDK also has a 16,384-byte read buffer
including the header. Normal READY/activity acknowledgements fit comfortably within it;
a maximum-sized 16 KiB PONG payload remains outside that SDK's single-read capacity.

Own activity display (September 11, 2026): the accepted local game report now carries
name, details, state and a registered artwork reference into one bounded session value.
The existing profile/member selectors use it for the current account without depending
on a Gateway self-presence echo. This is local presentation, not confirmation of remote
publication. Stopping sharing, clearing/disconnecting the game or ending the session
removes the local value; existing remote presence remains available as a fallback.
Other users and remote presence caches are unchanged. Synthetic rendered tests cover
both surfaces, same-game detail changes, clearing, dark/light and narrow/wide layouts.

### Server folders (September 11, 2026)

Server ordering, grouping, folder names and RGB colors use the normal-user
`GET/PATCH /users/@me/settings-proto/1` endpoint. This is unofficial and live-unverified.
The bounded adapter patches only the guild-folder subtree, retains unknown fields
and guild positions, checks the freshly read data version, and requires a confirming
response before changing the displayed layout. Conflicts and uncertain saves expose
a refresh/retry action. Other-client changes require the rail context menu's explicit
refresh; Gateway settings updates are not consumed in this slice.

Primary implementation evidence checked: [settings schema](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-protos)
and [discord.py-self HTTP adapter](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py).
Limits: 200 servers, 200 folder entries, 100 characters/400 bytes per name, 16 KiB
retained layout, 1 MiB settings response. Oversized settings disable organization
without hiding normal server navigation. Demo edits stay in memory; live edits persist
through Discord. No live account actions were performed in fast local validation.

### Invite acceptance (September 11, 2026)

Native invite cards offer a deliberate server join after a valid, bounded preview. The
normal-user `POST /invites/{code}` with an empty JSON body is unofficial, based on
[discord.py-self's accept_invite implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py).
It is single-attempt and uses the existing rate-limit and session-challenge handling.
A successful response confirms invite acceptance only; gateway guild/channel/permission
updates supply actual access. New gateway guilds enter the server rail. Expired or rejected
invites and uncertain writes show errors. Challenges, membership screening, and application
requirements remain unsupported in the native join flow. No challenge bypass or automatic retry.
Live acceptance and restricted-server flows remain unverified; offline demo cannot join.


### Account activity sharing and server observations (September 11, 2026)

The local Share game activity switch does not itself enable Discord's account-wide
`show_current_game` preference. Serein now reads that preference after local opt-in
and offers Enable on Discord only when it is disabled. This explicit action uses
normal-user `GET/PATCH /users/@me/settings-proto/1`, preserving other status/custom
status bytes and guarding the fresh data version. Unconfirmed writes are not retried
automatically. Turning local sharing off clears this client's game; it does not change
other clients' account preference. External preference changes are rechecked on a
new local opt-in cycle or an explicit retry after a hidden/error response.

Post-send `SESSIONS_REPLACE` observations distinguish an aggregate public game,
hidden game, current-session receipt, aggregate omission, and no confirmation.
They match application ID/type, not every beatmap detail. Local profile/member
previews remain local; neither a successful socket write nor a local preview proves
peer visibility. Per-server, per-game and friend privacy may still limit visibility.
No speculative activity fields or client identity changes were introduced.

Sources checked: [Discord's Activity Sharing FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7931156448919-Activity-Sharing-on-Discord-FAQ),
[settings protobuf schema](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-protos/blob/master/discord_protos/discord_users/v1/PreloadedUserSettings.proto),
and [discord.py-self session handling](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/state.py).
The normal-user protobuf/session behavior remains unofficial and live-unverified.
Local mock HTTP/WebSocket tests verify bounds, preservation, write confirmation,
listed/hidden/missing observations and reconnect resets. No live account was used.


### Server dropdown actions (September 11, 2026)

Create Invite uses documented [Create Channel Invite](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/channel#create-channel-invite)
(`POST /channels/{channel.id}/invites`) with editable expiry, use limits and temporary
membership. The default is 30 days, unlimited uses, non-temporary membership and a
new invite. The 30-day option follows the normal-user reference UI and exceeds the
public developer documentation's 7-day maximum; acceptance remains unverified.
The response must confirm the selected settings; rejection does not silently change them.
It requires known effective
Create Instant Invite and View Channel permissions for the selected guild channel.
The bounded response must confirm guild/channel IDs and a safe code before the UI
constructs a `https://discord.gg/` link. It never posts or shares the link automatically.
Selecting Create invite generates the link once. Each friend's Invite button separately
opens/reuses that friend's DM and sends the link through the existing message transport.
Only current friend relationships appear; each send needs a confirmed message response
before showing Sent. Ambiguous sends remain uncertain and cannot be retried for that link.
The friend list comes from unofficial READY/relationship events; individual sends use the
documented Create DM and Create Message routes. No live friend invites have been tested.
Leave Server uses documented [Leave Guild](https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/user#leave-guild)
(`DELETE /users/@me/guilds/{guild.id}`). Known owners cannot leave here; pending
messages or an active guild call prevent the request. Confirmed success removes
navigation and access through existing channel cleanup while preserving drafts.
One pending action and one bounded result are retained only in the session. Requests
never automatically retry; ambiguous results remain visibly uncertain, and stale
responses cannot change a new session or a subsequently rejoined guild. Malformed
successful invite responses are treated as uncertain writes.
These routes are documented developer API protocol evidence, not approval or proof
of normal-user compatibility. Synthetic state/HTTP checks cover this adapter; live
normal-user creation/leaving, service challenges and restricted guilds remain unverified.

### Account menu and session presence (September 12, 2026)

Click the footer avatar or account name to preview the global profile, select Online,
Idle, Do Not Disturb or Invisible, and apply/clear a custom status. Presence choices
last for this login session; they do not write Discord account settings or local storage.
Profile loading reuses the existing bounded global-profile adapter.

The existing Gateway opcode 3 publisher coalesces both game and custom activity into
one update, with at least five seconds between attempts and publication after
READY/RESUMED. Invisible omits activities from outbound updates while retaining the
local choices. Reidentification preserves the selected status. Do Not Disturb also
suppresses this client's native notification alerts.

[Discord's Update Presence and Activity Object documentation](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway-events#update-presence)
documents the status values and type-4 custom activity shape. The 128-character /
512-byte text ceiling is this client's limit. Normal-user custom-status acceptance,
cross-client interactions and public visibility remain unverified. The menu says
public visibility is unconfirmed; an outbound socket write is not confirmation.
Synthetic tests exercise UI actions, bounds, coalescing, clearing and reconnect.

### Inline attachment video (September 12, 2026)

MOV/MP4 attachments play inside the message with Discord-style overlay controls: a
centered play button on the picture, and a translucent bar over its lower edge with seek,
elapsed/total time and volume that hides while playing until the pointer or keyboard focus
returns. Every platform decodes through the same credential-free, validated Discord CDN
range reader; no attachment is opened as an OS URL and no webview is involved.

* Windows: Media Foundation. Windows codec availability controls playback (including HEVC).
* macOS: a bounded Rust MPEG-4 demuxer feeds VideoToolbox (H.264 and HEVC, including
  B-frame reordering) and Symphonia's pure-Rust AAC-LC decoder. HE-AAC, MP3-in-MP4,
  fragmented files, external data references and encrypted tracks are rejected.
* Linux: GStreamer `decodebin` pulls bounded byte ranges from that reader through
  `appsrc`; the installed plugins (base, good and libav are recommended by the package)
  decide which codecs play. Output is 48 kHz stereo PCM and RGBA pictures with
  orientation tags applied.

Unsupported containers/codecs show an error inside the player with the existing
download/open fallback. Limits are 100 MiB encoded, two hours, 1920 pixels per side and
1920x1080 total pixels, and mono/stereo audio up to 96 kHz. Rotated portrait video uses
the same pixel budget.
Only an explicit attachment Play starts decoding; leaving its visible message/channel,
hiding the app, logout, replacement or cancellation stops that player. Embeds with web
video pages continue using their external link action. No live Discord media was tested.

The native MPEG-4 source does not support external tracks; it receives an unnamed byte
stream without a base URL and Media Foundation starts with socket support disabled.
See [Microsoft MPEG-4 source documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/mpeg-4-file-source).
