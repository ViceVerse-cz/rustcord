# Initial performance evidence

Measured 2026-09-09 on an Apple M1 Pro (8 CPU cores), 16 GiB RAM, macOS 27.0 beta build 26A5425a, arm64, Rust 1.98.1. These are initial samples, not a completed acceptance benchmark.

| Workload / metric | Actual result | Limits |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic reducer replay | 100,000 events in 21.99 ms, release | Not transport, parsing, UI frame time or live messaging |
| Retained replay timeline | 500 messages; 156,992–157,477 estimated entity bytes over the last 100 cycles | Demonstrates the application timeline bound, not process RSS/GPU stability |
| Native synthetic window | Debug build launched and was interactive; keyboard-composed synthetic message appeared in timeline | No p95 startup measurement; no live account |
| Settled synthetic process | `ps` RSS 118,896 KiB (~116.1 MiB), sampled CPU 0.0% | Debug, 50-message synthetic page plus one send; wgpu/Metal; 1120×760 requested logical window, observed screenshot 1088×768. Display scale not instrumented |
| Release/package size | Recorded in progress.md after packaging | System webview/OS frameworks are external footprint; no audio engine |

The sampled debug RSS exceeds the 80 MiB settled text-idle target and is below the 150 MiB active-channel starting target, but these workloads are not the authenticated acceptance workload. No pass is claimed for either. Shader/GPU allocations, driver components, login webview helper processes, cold/warm login bandwidth, 60 Hz scroll frame p95, cached-navigation p95, and long-running process-memory soak are unmeasured. The fixture path does not open WebKit, keyring or SQLite; those costs need separate controlled-session measurement.

The release profile uses thin LTO, one codegen unit and stripped executable debug information with separate line-table symbols. The first optimized build took 2m39s in this environment while a developer audit tool also compiled; build time is not startup time.

Run `cargo replay` for the reproducible synthetic reducer workload. Use `cargo xtask package` for the actual staged package, then measure the native process with platform tools. Targets in SPEC.md remain targets. No voice or image-preview resource claims are made.


September 10 continuation: reducer replay measured 19.791708 ms for the same 100,000 synthetic events, retaining 500 records / 156,992–157,477 estimated bytes. The package now embeds 16.51 MiB of licensed font data; its local ad-hoc-signed macOS executable is 36,933,088 bytes (~35.2 MiB). Formatting has an 8192-byte/128-line per-message input ceiling and a 64-entry/1 MiB estimated source/parsed-span cache. Spoiler consent stores original text bounded by the active timeline. These additions have no new process RSS, GPU or p95 frame measurements yet; the September 9 memory sample must not be reused as their measured footprint.

September 10 avatar/member addition: active member data is capped at 100 list positions / 128 KiB, separate from navigation and messages. Avatar textures are capped at 64 × 128 × 128 × 4 = 4 MiB; eight queued decoded outputs add at most 512 KiB. One image worker holds a compressed body capped at 512 KiB and decodes with dimensions at most 256×256 and a 1 MiB allocation limit before resizing to 128×128. Disk metadata is streamed with 32 eviction candidates, rather than retaining a full RAM index. Avatar disk allowance is deliberately generous (1 GiB / 4096 files per account) to reduce repeat network work. These are tested component ceilings, not whole-process RSS, GPU-driver totals or long-running measurements. No new codec dependency or bitmap asset was added.

macOS arm64 release packaging passed with strict ad-hoc signature verification. Executable: **37,443,712 bytes** (35.71 MiB), up **359,296 bytes** (0.97%) from the preceding UI build. No Developer ID/notarization or Windows/Linux packaging validation is claimed.

## September 10: optional one-to-one DM voice

Same macOS arm64 host/toolchain, release thin-LTO build. Text executable: **37,634,384 bytes** (35.89 MiB). Voice executable: **40,491,296 bytes** (38.62 MiB), **+2,856,912 bytes / 7.59%** over the current text build. Both local packages passed strict ad-hoc signature verification; neither is notarized. `otool -L` selects system frameworks and libraries only, with no Homebrew/libopus dynamic-library dependency. The codec is statically bundled. Voice packages also include codec/crypto notices and the modified MPL HPKE component source.

The voice-enabled release launched natively with `--demo`; the DM header exposed Call/Audio, Call was disabled, and the Audio menu's accessibility text reported that microphone/speakers are unavailable in preview. This is an offline startup/UI check, not physical audio or Discord validation. The preview was closed after inspection.

Call media budgets include four eight-frame PCM rings/queues (20 ms, 960 mono f32 samples each: 120 KiB sample storage total), eight encoded jitter packets (at most 10,200 bytes), 64 KiB voice WebSocket messages and 4 KiB UDP input packets. Codec, MLS, device/driver, task and operating-system allocations are additional. Call audio threads/devices stop on leave; the next call waits for native teardown completion. These are component limits and ownership checks, not measured call RSS or a hardware teardown result. No active-call CPU, RSS, latency, audio-quality, device-change or long-duration measurement is claimed.

## September 10: categories, embeds and server icons

Same macOS arm64 host/toolchain. Text executable: **37,972,480 bytes** (36.21 MiB), +338,096 bytes over the preceding text build. Voice executable: **40,844,544 bytes** (38.95 MiB), +353,248 bytes over the preceding voice build. Both packages passed strict local ad-hoc signature verification. The lockfile has no new package entries, only direct edges to existing SHA-256/URL/serde dependencies. No new image codec, font or bitmap asset was bundled.

The shared avatar/icon/embed texture allowance is now 64 entries / 16 MiB RGBA, replacing the preceding avatar-only 4 MiB bound. Two decoded-result slots add at most 2 MiB. One worker holds at most a 2 MiB encoded response and uses an 8 MiB PNG decoder allocation limit for embeds (512 KiB / 1 MiB for avatars/icons); dimensions and resized outputs have separate limits. Disk remains 1 GiB / 4096 files / 90 days per account. These are component ceilings, not whole-process RSS or GPU measurements.

Embed metadata is limited to 10 cards, 25 fields/card and 64 KiB/message, counted within the existing 4 MiB timeline and 1 MiB pending-patch limits. Parsed message/embed sections share the existing 64-entry / 1 MiB formatting cache. Spoiler consent retains a bounded copy of active revealed message content and embed metadata. SQLite eviction includes serialized embed bytes and preserves its 64 MiB database ceiling. Navigation remains limited to 4000 items / 4 MiB metadata; collapsed category keys are pruned with navigation.

A native voice-build offline preview verified complete card/image layout, category collapse/selection visibility, generated server icons and external-link confirmation at approximately 1088×768. No production CDN request, authenticated workload, process-memory/frame-time benchmark, hardware call or Windows/Linux run was measured. Earlier RSS samples do not represent these additions.

September 10 inline-link correction: locally ad-hoc-signed text executable **37,988,976 bytes**; voice **40,844,624 bytes**. The existing parser and native egui link widgets are reused, with no new dependencies/assets. Message and embed text keep their shared bounded formatting cache. Native synthetic layout and pointer checks passed; no new RSS/frame-time or live-service measurement was taken.
